## Project Overview

This project investigates sales performance and profitability across
products, customers, sales territories, and sales channels over 36
months. The work follows an end-to-end analytical process: translating a
stakeholder request into clear business questions, profiling and
preparing source data in PostgreSQL, building a business-ready star
schema, defining measures in Power BI, and communicating findings
through an executive report.

The analysis deliberately evaluates **revenue and profitability
together**. High sales do not automatically mean strong business
performance: product categories and territories can contribute
substantial revenue while producing relatively low margins or losses.

## Business Problem

Management observed changes in sales performance and needed to
understand what was driving those changes. The business requested a
report that could explore performance across products, customers,
territories, and sales channels, while tracking revenue and
profitability over time.

The analysis was designed to answer a practical management question:

> Are sales growth and business profitability moving together, and where
> should management investigate performance?

The report supports exploration of sales trends, category and product
performance, territory results, and differences between the Reseller and
Internet channels.

## Business Objectives

The analysis was scoped around five objectives:

1.  **Understand overall performance** using sales, gross profit, and
    profit margin.
2.  **Track performance over time** and compare fiscal years with the
    prior year.
3.  **Identify product performance differences**, including the
    strongest and weakest contributors to gross profit.
4.  **Compare sales territories** to identify regions that drive results
    and regions that may need attention.
5.  **Investigate profitability drivers**, including product mix, sales
    channel, and the relationship between sales amount and product cost.

### Core business measures

-   **Total Sales:** revenue recorded in the source sales data.
-   **Gross Profit:** Total Sales minus Total Cost.
-   **Profit Margin %:** Gross Profit divided by Total Sales.

Units, orders, average order value, average selling price, profit per
unit, and year-over-year measures provide additional context.

## Executive Summary

The headline results show that revenue grew strongly over the analysis
period, but margins did not keep pace. Profitability also varied
substantially by product category, territory, and sales channel.

  Measure / finding                            Result
  ------------------------------- -------------------
  Overall sales                          **\$109.8M**
  Overall gross profit                    **\$12.6M**
  Overall profit margin                     **11.4%**
  FY2018 sales                                \$23.9M
  FY2020 sales                                \$51.9M
  FY2018 margin                                 12.7%
  FY2020 margin                                 11.2%
  Bikes share of sales                            86%
  Accessories margin                            49.9%
  Australia margin                  Approximately 34%
  Touring Bikes reseller margin               -11.84%
  Touring Bikes Internet margin                37.84%

### Main takeaways

-   **Sales more than doubled, while margin declined.** Annual sales
    rose from \$23.9M in FY2018 to \$51.9M in FY2020, while margin fell
    from 12.7% to 11.2%.
-   **Revenue and profit were concentrated differently.** Bikes
    generated approximately 86% of sales at an 11.1% margin, while
    Accessories generated a 49.9% margin on a much smaller revenue base.
-   **Territory results differed sharply.** Australia contributed about
    10% of sales but 29% of gross profit, with a margin of approximately
    34%. Central, Southeast, and Northeast together represented around
    21% of sales but earned margins of roughly 2%.
-   **Some products performed very differently by channel.** Touring
    Bikes lost money through Resellers at a -11.84% margin but were
    profitable through the Internet channel at a 37.84% margin.
-   **The recorded discount field was unreliable.** The source discount
    percentage was zero on every row, even though some reseller sales
    amounts were below their extended amounts. Effective discounts were
    therefore derived for investigation, while Sales Amount remained the
    source of truth.

## Dataset and Data Model

The source data consists of AdventureWorks sales information across six
source tables, with 121,253 sales order lines in the sales data. The
source inventory also includes a territory table used to describe sales
regions.

                   attributes                             
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The report's Gold layer contains six tables: `fact_sales`,
`dim_customer`, `dim_product`, `dim_reseller`, `dim_sales_territory`,
and `dim_date`. Sales order metadata was merged into the fact table
because it shared the same grain and had a one-to-one relationship
through the sales order line key.

### Star schema

The sales fact table is the centre of the model. It connects to five
dimensions:

  Fact-table key        Dimension
  --------------------- -----------------------
  `SalesTerritoryKey`   `dim_sales_territory`
  `ResellerKey`         `dim_reseller`
  `CustomerKey`         `dim_customer`
  `ProductKey`          `dim_product`
  Date keys             `dim_date`

The model uses one-to-many relationships from dimensions to the sales
fact table, with single-direction filtering. This structure supports
consistent calculations and allows users to slice results by product,
customer, reseller, territory, and date.

## End-to-End Workflow

The project followed a structured workflow from the original stakeholder
request to management recommendations.

1.  **Understand the business request** --- define the management
    problem and the decisions the analysis should support.
2.  **Gather requirements** --- confirm the reporting period, metrics,
    channels, and territories in scope.
3.  **Inventory and profile the data** --- inspect row counts, grain,
    key completeness, duplicates, date validity, foreign keys, and
    financial calculations.
4.  **Build the Bronze layer** --- load source CSV data in its raw form.
5.  **Create the Silver layer** --- standardize text, assign appropriate
    data types, validate records, and apply integrity rules.
6.  **Create the Gold layer** --- build a validated, business-ready star
    schema.
7.  **Develop the Power BI semantic model** --- configure relationships,
    date roles, measures, and model organization.
8.  **Analyze results** --- compare fiscal-year trends, product
    profitability, territories, and sales channels.
9.  **Communicate findings** --- present the results and actionable
    recommendations in an executive report.

## Data Quality and Preparation

Data profiling was used to establish whether the source could reliably
answer the business questions before reporting began.

### Profiling and validation checks

-   Confirmed the sales table contained **121,253 sales order lines**.
-   Checked key completeness and uniqueness at the expected grain.
-   Checked dimension keys and fact-table foreign-key integrity; no
    orphan keys were found for Product, Customer, Reseller, Sales
    Territory, or Date.
-   Checked date ranges and calendar values.
-   Checked numeric validity for quantity, unit price, sales amount,
    standard cost, and total product cost under the tested business
    rules.
-   Reconciled total product cost against quantity multiplied by
    standard cost.
-   Investigated missing ship dates and the inconsistency in the
    discount percentage field.
-   Validated row counts and business metrics between the Silver and
    Gold layers.

                                                  schema
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Silver-layer transformations

-   Applied appropriate data types to columns.
-   Used `TRIM()` to remove surrounding whitespace.
-   Used `INITCAP()` for standardized title case and `UPPER()` for codes
    and SKUs where appropriate.
-   Used `REGEXP_REPLACE()` to remove currency symbols and thousands
    separators before numeric conversion.
-   Applied key, nullability, and positive-value constraints where
    appropriate to the business rules.
-   Preserved valid `-1` sentinel keys representing `[Not Applicable]`
    members and created matching dimension records where required.
-   Treated the `1900-01-01` date as a technical placeholder for the
    `-1` sentinel, not as a real transaction date.

### Important reconciliation findings

**1. The discount percentage field was zero on every row.**

The source column `unit_price_discount_pct` contained `0.00%` across all
121,253 rows, including the freshly downloaded source file. It therefore
could not be used to measure the actual discount behaviour in the
affected transactions.

**2. Sales Amount was retained as the source of truth.**

A total of 15,684 rows (12.9%), all in the Reseller channel, differed
from the expected calculation using quantity, unit price, and the
recorded discount field. Of these, 12,402 were small unit-price
precision differences where Sales Amount equalled Extended Amount. The
remaining 3,282 rows had Sales Amount below Extended Amount, indicating
price reductions not represented in the discount percentage column.

Recalculating sales using the formula and the zeroed discount field
would have overstated sales by approximately **\$527K (0.5%)** and
margin by about **0.4 percentage points**. For this reason, the analysis
retained Sales Amount and derived an effective discount from Extended
Amount and Sales Amount where needed for investigation.

**3. Missing ship dates were preserved rather than fabricated.**

There were 2,113 missing `ShipDateKey` values, concentrated in orders
placed from 9--15 June 2020. The pattern was consistent with orders near
the end of the extract that had not yet shipped. These values were left
null.

**4. Product cost reconciliation was close.**

Total Product Cost closely matched Quantity multiplied by Product
Standard Cost, with a maximum difference of \$0.15 and an average
absolute difference of approximately \$0.004, consistent with rounding.

## Power BI Semantic Model

The Gold tables were loaded into Power BI to create a semantic model
designed for reliable business analysis rather than visual presentation
alone.

### Model design

-   Loaded only the six Gold tables into Power BI; Bronze and Silver
    remained preparation and validation layers.
-   Connected each dimension to `fact_sales` using one-to-many
    relationships and single-direction filtering.
-   Used `dim_date` as the date dimension for the July--June fiscal
    calendar.
-   Set the order date relationship as active, with due date and ship
    date relationships inactive so the different date roles could be
    used through DAX when required.
-   Hid technical foreign-key columns from report users.
-   Stored measures in a dedicated measure table.

### Fiscal calendar

The analysis covers FY2018--FY2020, with the fiscal year running from
July through June. For example, FY2018 contains:

-   Q1: July--September 2017
-   Q2: October--December 2017
-   Q3: January--March 2018
-   Q4: April--June 2018

The existing date dimension was used rather than relying on Power BI's
automatic date table. Month labels were sorted by a month key so they
appear in fiscal-calendar order rather than alphabetically.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

These measures support comparisons across time, territory, product, and
channel using consistent definitions.

### Executive Overview

The Executive Overview uses three main filters:

-   Date Range
-   Territory
-   Channel

It focuses on three questions:

1.  How are sales changing over time? --- monthly Total Sales compared
    with Sales PY.
2.  How are revenue and profit changing by fiscal year? --- revenue and
    profit by fiscal year.
3.  Which territories perform well or poorly? --- territory performance.

The wider report also investigates product categories, top and bottom
products, subcategory performance, and reseller-versus-Internet
profitability.

## Key Business Findings

### 1. Revenue growth came with margin pressure

Sales increased from **\$23.9M in FY2018 to \$51.9M in FY2020**, while
profit margin decreased from **12.7% to 11.2%**. Revenue growth alone
therefore gives an incomplete view of business performance: margin needs
to be monitored alongside sales.

### 2. Bikes dominate revenue, but other categories deliver higher margins

  Category        Total sales   Gross profit   Margin
  ------------- ------------- -------------- --------
  Bikes               \$94.6M        \$10.5M    11.1%
  Components          \$11.8M         \$1.0M     8.8%
  Clothing             \$2.1M         \$0.4M    17.4%
  Accessories          \$1.3M         \$0.6M    49.9%

**Interpretation:** Bikes are the main revenue driver, accounting for
approximately 86% of sales, but their margin is relatively thin.
Accessories and Clothing generate less revenue but higher margins.
Components have a comparatively low margin of 8.8%.

The top 10 products by gross profit were all Bikes, specifically
Mountain-200 and Road-150 variants. Together, they generated
approximately \$6.71M gross profit at a 23.24% margin. The bottom 10
products generated approximately **-\$518K gross profit**, at an
aggregate margin of about **-8.85%**.

### 3. Touring Bike losses are concentrated in the Reseller channel

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Touring            Revenue   Product cost   Gross profit         Margin
  Bikes                                                    
  channel                                                  
  ----------- -------------- -------------- -------------- --------------
  Reseller          \$10.45M       \$11.69M       -\$1.24M        -11.84%

  Internet           \$3.84M        \$2.39M        \$1.45M         37.84%
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Seven of the ten products in the bottom 10 were Touring Bikes. Looking
only at product-level performance could suggest that Touring Bikes are
inherently unprofitable. Comparing channels changes the interpretation:
Touring Bikes were profitable online but sold below standard product
cost through Resellers.

This points to a channel-specific pricing or cost issue that needs
further investigation, rather than a product-wide problem.

### 4. Discount depth does not explain reseller margin differences

  Reseller subcategory     Average effective discount   Gross margin
  ---------------------- ---------------------------- --------------
  Touring Bikes                                 2.33%        -11.84%
  Road Bikes                                    0.23%         -3.99%
  Mountain Bikes                                0.66%          5.36%
  Jerseys                                       0.75%        -22.91%
  Caps                                          0.89%        -18.17%
  Touring Frames                                0.16%         -0.34%
  Helmets                                       1.38%         32.99%
  Wheels                                        0.09%         25.82%

The observed reseller losses do not track closely with effective
discount depth. For example, reseller Helmets had a 1.38% average
effective discount and a 32.99% margin, while Road Bikes had a 0.23%
discount and a negative margin.

For Touring Bikes, removing the observed discount would still leave an
estimated margin of about -9%. The findings therefore point toward
reseller pricing relative to standard product cost, rather than discount
depth alone. The underlying reason for the pricing structure was not
established by this analysis.

### 5. Territory performance is uneven

-   **Australia** contributed approximately 10% of sales but 29% of
    gross profit, at a margin of about 34%.
-   **Central, Southeast, and Northeast** together contributed around
    21% of sales while earning margins of roughly 2%.
-   **Southwest, Canada, and Northwest** together generated about half
    of all sales, approximately \$56M.

The contrast between revenue contribution and profit contribution shows
why territories should be assessed using both sales and margin.

## Recommendations

### 1. Review reseller pricing for finished bikes

Review reseller price lists against standard product costs for Touring,
Road, and Mountain Bikes, starting with the Touring-1000 and
Touring-3000 lines. The Touring Bike reseller channel recorded
approximately **\$1.24M in gross losses**, and the bottom 10 products
together lost approximately \$518K.

Discount caps alone are unlikely to resolve the issue because the
observed average effective discounts were relatively small. Confirm
standard costs and reseller pricing rules, especially because the same
Touring Bikes were profitable through the Internet channel.

### 2. Grow sales of high-margin complementary categories

Consider bundling Accessories and Clothing with Bike purchases---for
example, helmets or shorts alongside a bike. Accessories had a 49.9%
margin and Clothing had a 17.4% margin in this analysis. These
categories may offer opportunities to improve the profitability of the
overall product mix.

### 3. Audit pricing for Jerseys, Caps, and selected Road Bikes

Investigate reseller price lists for Jerseys, Caps, and Road-650 Red,
44. Reseller Jerseys had a -22.91% margin and Caps had a -18.17% margin.
Review whether these products are being sold below an appropriate
cost-based price.

### 4. Investigate low-margin territories

Prioritize Central, Southeast, and Northeast for further investigation.
Compare their product mix, channel mix, and pricing patterns with
stronger-performing territories such as Australia. The aim is to
identify which factors explain the margin gap before deciding on
corrective action.

## Limitations and Considerations

-   **Discount field quality:** `unit_price_discount_pct` was zero for
    every source row. Effective discounts were derived from Extended
    Amount and Sales Amount for analysis, but the cause of the
    source-field issue could not be confirmed from public documentation.
-   **Missing ship dates:** 2,113 orders dated 9--15 June 2020 had no
    `ShipDateKey`. Ship-date analysis near the end of the reporting
    period should be treated cautiously.
-   **Reseller pricing cause not confirmed:** The analysis identifies
    where reseller sales lose money but does not establish why reseller
    prices fall below standard product cost. Input from the pricing
    owner is needed.
-   **Interpretation of sentinels:** The `-1` keys and `1900-01-01`
    placeholder are modelling conventions, not real business entities or
    transaction dates.
-   **Scope:** Findings describe the supplied AdventureWorks extract and
    its July 2017--June 2020 period; they should not be assumed to
    describe other periods without further validation.

## How to Explore the Project

1.  Start with the executive summary to understand the business question
    and headline findings.
2.  Review the SQL scripts to follow the profiling, cleaning,
    validation, and Gold-layer modelling process.
3.  Inspect the star schema and confirm that the fact-table grain and
    dimension relationships support the analysis.
4.  Open the Power BI report, if included, and use the date, territory,
    and channel filters to explore results.
5.  Compare revenue and gross profit together, then investigate
    category, subcategory, and channel-level margins.
6.  Use the recommendations as hypotheses for further business
    investigation, especially the reseller pricing issue.

## Final Takeaway

**Revenue growth is not the same as profitable growth.** This project
demonstrates how data profiling, sound modelling, and business-focused
analysis can move beyond reporting what happened to identify where
management should investigate---and why looking at product and channel
performance together can change the conclusion.
